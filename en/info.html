    <h2>Mental Health for Everyone - Demonstration on March 9, 2024</h2>
    <p>
      The Mental Health for Everyone demonstration is a peaceful and
      substance-free family event and expression, demanding
      investments and actions to solve the mental health crisis.
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">For Whom?</h3>
    <p>
      We welcome all entities that cherish care, peace, non-violence, and human rights
      to join together in advocating for mental health. Welcome all ordinary individuals, families,
      organizations, associations, networks, professionals, and entrepreneurs. And, of course,
      <strong>those suffering from mental health problems!</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mental Health for Everyone demonstration is a way for citizens
      to declare that the cycle of distress must be broken. We demand from the government
      substantial investments in well-being and political actions to address
      mental health problems.
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">Where?</h3>
    <p>
      The Mental Health for Everyone demonstration takes place in Helsinki.
      We march from Senate Square to the Parliament House. Local
      satellite demonstrations are encouraged to be organized simultaneously
      throughout Finland.
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">When?</h3>
    <p>Sun, March 9, 2024</p>

    <h3 class="question">Why?</h3>
    <p>
      At least every fifth Finn experiences mental health disorders within a year,
      and every fifth gets depressed during their lifetime.
      Nowadays, over half of all disability pensions are granted due to
      mental health and behavioral disorders. The increasing prevalence of mental health problems
      reflects a change in society. To change the direction of development,
      it is essential to address, among other things, politics, working conditions,
      and social structures that increase people's mental burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, in the 21st century, mental health services have not been invested in to the same extent
      as other healthcare. The share of mental health services
      in healthcare expenditure has been declining throughout the 21st century,
      and in 2021, it was only 4.5 percent of all expenditures.
      Psychiatric care gets an increasingly smaller share of specialized healthcare
      funding. [1]
    </p>
    <p>
      WHO has stated that good mental health also means good physical health.
      Mental health and public health, human rights, and
      socioeconomic development are inseparably linked. Investing
      in mental health is an investment in a better life and future
      for all of us. [2]
    </p>
    <p>
      The demonstration calls for the government to make substantial investments
      in well-being and concrete political actions to address mental health problems.
