    <h2>Mental Health Belongs to Everyone! - Protest on June 3, 2024</h2>
    <p class="fore">
      The Mental Health Belongs to Everyone! - Protest is a peaceful and substance-free event for the whole family, with the purpose of demanding investments and concrete actions to solve the mental health crisis.
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">For whom?</h3>
    <p>
      Everyone that values care, peace, non-violence, and human rights are more than welcome to come together to protest for mental
      health. All ordinary people, families, organizations, associations, networks, professionals, and
      entrepreneurs are welcome. And of course, <strong>those with mental health issues!</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mental Health Belongs to Everyone! - Protest is a way for citizens to express that the cycle of distress must be
      broken immediately! We demand significant investments in well-being from the government and political action to address mental
      health issues.
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">Where?</h3>
    <p>
      The Mental Health Belongs to Everyone! - Protest will take place in Helsinki. We will march from the Senate Square to the
      location of the after-event (to be announced later). Local satellite protests are encouraged to be organized
      simultaneously across Finland.
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">When?</h3>
    <p>Monday, June 3, 2024</p>

    <h3 class="question">Why?</h3>
    <p>
      At least one in five Finns has to experience mental health disorders annually. One in five Finns has to go through depression during their lifetime.
      Currently over half of all disability pensions are granted due to mental health and behavioral
      disorders. The increasing prevalence of mental health problems reflects a change in our society. If we want to change
      the direction of this development, it is important to address factors such as politics, working conditions, and
      societal structures that increase people's mental burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, investments in mental health services have not been in correlation with the amount of patients.
      The share of mental health services in total healthcare expenditure has been declining throughout
      the 21st century and was only 4.5 percent of all expenditure in 2021. Psychiatric care receives an increasingly
      smaller share of funding for specialized healthcare. [1]
    </p>
    <p>
      The WHO has stated that good mental health also contributes to good physical health. Mental health and public health, human
      rights, and socioeconomic development are inseparable. Investing in mental health is an investment in a better
      life and future for all of us. [2]
    </p>
    <p>
      The protest demands significant investments in well-being from the government and concrete political actions to
      address mental health issues.
